# Train-Scheduler
UW Coding Bootcamp HW 07-Week
The Goal of this assignment is to setup a Firecase key to store data; create a front end in which a user can enter data, which in turn populates a train schedule; and use Moment.js to create formulas to calculate time to arrival, etc.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase and the Moment.js library.

## Installation
Nothing special here.  Just check it out using your favorite web browser.

## Usage
In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Original Instructions
Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
